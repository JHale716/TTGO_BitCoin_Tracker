# TTGO_BitCoin_Tracker

An adaption of https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T4-DEMO to run on the https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display

  Liked the idea and have the https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO-T-Display so adapted to suit.

  Remember to update the wifi stuff before uploading ;) Happy coding!
  
  You will also need libraries in addition to the normal inbuilt ones:
  https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
  https://github.com/LennartHennigs/Button2
  
Button 2 is defined, as a carry over from the TTGO_T_Display code, may or may not do anythign with these, but there are two buttons to do something with.
